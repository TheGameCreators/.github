# TheGameCreators FAQ for Technical Support

**Q**> How do I buy GameGuru Classic, GameGuru MAX, AGK Classic or AGK Studio?
Answer: **You can find our products on the Steam website, and download their Steam client to install and run them. Here is a link to all our products: https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=TheGameCreators**

**Q**> Is TGC interested in new services to help your website visibility, website authority, protection, selling your company, viewing photos, and other offers that might be considered the topic of email spamming?
Answer: **No, TGC is not interested in these topics and considers such material as SPAM when they are sent to our technical support system.**

**Q**> Is TGC interested in selling your company?
Answer: **No, TGC is not looking to sell the company.**

**Q**> We have a pupil who attends our school and is writing and illustrating stories that include characters from your products and concerned he will breach your copyright?
Answer: **All the assets that are built into our game-making products are allowed to be used in games you make with no copyright issues or license fees to pay. It is generally agreed that providing you use our game maker products when using the assets we provide, you are free to exploit those assets as part of your game commercially with no issues. It goes without saying that you cannot take our assets and sell them separately as your own assets, they can only be included in a derivative work produced by our game-making products.**

**Q**> I purchased your product but I lost my steam account. How can I download my Game Guru Max purchase again, without steam?
Answer: **We only distribute our game-making products through Steam these days and under the Steam system, once you use a key on a Steam account it binds it to that account and disables the key. The only way to retrieve that product is to find the details of your old Steam account and restore it on your PC. Steam support will be able to help you retrieve your old account and once you are restored, you can find and download the products you purchased for that account.**

**Q**> I bought a product from your a while ago and now it is misbehaving, but when I tried to get a new download for the product I could not find it. Can you help?
Answer: **If your order was around 2020 it is likely it was a download from our TGC website. We have since moved all our products to Steam and use Steam Keys to provide our software now.Â  You can download the Steam client and then use your key(s) to activate your product and then install a fresh copy of the product onto your PC.**

## GameGuru Classic and MAX

**Q**> I am an artist and create models in the FBX file format, does GameGuru MAX allow me to import my FBX models?
Answer: **Yes, GameGuru MAX can import 3D models in the FBX, GLTF, OBJ, DBO, and X file formats.**

**Q**> I have a question about one of your DLCs. Can you help?
Answer: **Most of the DLC found in GameGuru Classic and GameGuru MAX are created by third-party artists, and you can make suggestions for additions and changes directly to the artist.**

**Q**> I've been using GameGuru since launch (purchased on Steam). Recently I can't start it anymore. A white screen appears, it closes after a few seconds and the start button on Steam is back to Start. After a new installation, it can be started exactly once, after which the problem is as described above. I would like to continue using the program, but unfortunately, it is very frustrating at the moment. My system: CPU: AMD A10 7850K RAM: 16GB Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 560. Can you help?
Answer: **If you can run the software once the first time only, and then it crashes on subsequent times, it sounds like the AMD HOT FIX is causing you to crash. You can disable the AMD HOT FIX by renaming the "amdfix.ini" file to "noamdfix.ini" and deleting d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll from the same folder. The GameGuru MAX root folder is typically found here "C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GameGuru MAX".**

**Q**> Is there or will there be an option to import objects I created in Blender 3d?
Answer: **GameGuru MAX can import 3D models from Blender 3D if you export them in an FBX file format.**

## AppGameKit

**Q**> I have a question about the AGK Mobile app that runs on my Android and iOS devices. Can you help?
Answer: **AGK Mobile is developed by a third-party developer. We have no creation products that run on Android. We do sell AppGameKit which enables export to an APK that runs on Android, but you need to do the creation on a PC in Windows.**

**Q**> What AGK AppGameKit products do you sell?
Answer: **We sell two AGK products through Steam, AppGameKit Classic and AppGameKit Studio. Classic was created first and later we developed Studio and included more commands, features, and a new IDE. We also sell DLC created by ourselves and by third-parties that are compatible with AGK Classic and AGK Studio. We do not sell any products through our own TGC website and instead sell through Steam.**

## Legacy Products

**Q**> I am making a game using the original DarkBasic and I noticed it had this pop-up saying "Enhancements for 6 days" and its counting down to 0. I would like to still use 1.0, do you still provide support?
Answer: **We no longer officially support our older legacy products such as DarkBASIC, DarkBASIC Pro, The 3D Gamemaker, and FPS Creator, and are unable to provide help if you choose to use them on modern Windows platforms. You may find some old forums still running that have a community surrounding these products, and they are your best bet for getting advice on what you are attempting. Thanks for checking out our past products, we appreciate the attention they still garner!**

## Miscellaneous
