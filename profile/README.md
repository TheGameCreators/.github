**Q**> We have a pupil who attends our school and is writing and illustrating stories that include characters from your products and concerned he will breach your copyright?
Answer: **All the assets that are built into our game-making products are allowed to be used in games you make with no copyright issues or license fees to pay. It is generally agreed that providing you use our game maker products when using the assets we provide, you are free to exploit those assets as part of your game commercially with no issues. It goes without saying that you cannot take our assets and sell them separately as your own assets, they can only be included in a derivative work produced by our game-making products.**

**Q**> I purchased your product but I lost my steam account. How can I download my Game Guru Max purchase again, without steam?
Answer: **We only distribute our game-making products through Steam these days and under the Steam system, once you use a key on a Steam account it binds it to that account and disables the key. The only way to retrieve that product is to find the details of your old Steam account and restore it on your PC. Steam support will be able to help you retrieve your old account and once you are restored, you can find and download the products you purchased for that account.**

**Q**> I bought a product from your a while ago and now it is misbehaving, but when I tried to get a new download for the product I could not find it. Can you help?
Answer: **If your order was around 2020 it is likely it was a download from our TGC website. We have since moved all our products to Steam and use Steam Keys to provide our software now.  You can download the Steam client and then use your key(s) to activate your product and then install a fresh copy of the product onto your PC.**

**Q**> We are looking to create an app for our website xyz.com, can you help?
Answer: **TGC only develops the game-making tools themselves, and does not typically create games and apps directly. The best place to find help creating a game or app is our DISCORD and FORUM channels. The GameGuru DISCORD is '[https://discord.com/channels/950796460683829329/1190570343451082852](https://discord.gg/nFtfqQ7V)' and the AGK FORUM is 'https://forum.thegamecreators.com/board/59'.**

**Q**> The download link of FPS Creator X10 is wrong in my product list, can you please correct this? The link always download FPS creator classic?
Answer: **We no longer sell any FPS Creator products, including FPS Creator X10. We have no authorized sellers or distributors of this product as well, so if you bought this product from a source other than TGC, you should claim a refund immediately.**

**Q**> Can't log in, forgot password, need to reset password. HELP. Trying to update my product?
Answer: **We only sell products through Steam these days so if you refer to not being able to log into Steam then you need to contact Steam. If you are referring to an older purchase directly with TGC, please provide the exact email you used when you registered a TGC account and we will be able to email you your password to that email address. From there, you can log into the TGC account and view your Products tab to download older products you have purchased directly from TGC.**



## GameGuru Classic and MAX

**Q**> I am an artist and create models in the FBX file format, does GameGuru MAX allow me to import my FBX models?
Answer: **Yes, GameGuru MAX can import 3D models in the FBX, GLTF, OBJ, DBO, and X file formats.**

**Q**> I have a question about one of your DLCs. Can you help?
Answer: **Most of the DLC found in GameGuru Classic and GameGuru MAX are created by third-party artists, and you can make suggestions for additions and changes directly to the artist.**

**Q**> I've been using GameGuru and recently I can't start it anymore or having problems for some reason. It used to work perfectly and now it just bugs out and other strange stuff all the time. The update messed up my ability to even use the software. I have verified the files and then it updates and 5-10 mins later folders are missing. I need help.
Answer: **If you are experiencing unusual behavior after a period of normal running, it may be related to a recent update. You can revert to earlier updates by using the Steam client app properties Beta tab to roll back to earlier versions, all are date stamped so you can go back several years if need be. The issue could also be caused by a system issue such as a failing hard drive, virus activity, or other OS problem so worth checking PC integrity. Failing these, you can also do a complete reset by backing up your projects thoroughly and then performing a clean reinstall of the software. If your problems are within the software itself, you have likely encountered a bug, in which case you can submit it to our GitHub issues board here: "https://github.com/TheGameCreators/GameGuruRepo/issues".**

**Q**> I've been using GameGuru since launch (purchased on Steam). Recently I can't start it anymore. A white screen appears, it closes after a few seconds and the start button on Steam is back to Start. After a new installation, it can be started exactly once, after which the problem is as described above. I would like to continue using the program, but unfortunately, it is very frustrating at the moment. My system: CPU: AMD A10 7850K RAM: 16GB Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 560. Can you help?
Answer: **If you can run the software once the first time only, and then it crashes on subsequent times, it sounds like the AMD HOT FIX is causing you to crash. You can disable the AMD HOT FIX by renaming the "amdfix.ini" file to "noamdfix.ini" and deleting d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll from the same folder. The GameGuru MAX root folder is typically found here "C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GameGuru MAX".**

**Q**> Is there or will there be an option to import objects I created in Blender 3d?
Answer: **GameGuru MAX can import 3D models from Blender 3D if you export them in an FBX file format.**

**Q**> I have been working on a project and the program re-writes my files or deletes items out of the game I am building. When I reload the program it will load in a previously saved version (sometimes months old). How can I fix this?
Answer: **If you find you are having problems with the files you save and export, it could be related to corruption in the software or your OS/File System. We commend backing up your projects and files, and performing a full reinstall of the software, and run disk checks to make sure you have no issues with your storage systems. In development, these things will happen from time to time, and we always recommend making local and non-local (cloud) backups of your important files and work so you do not lose more than a few days of work.**

**Q**> I have been able to open the program while online then working offline and now today I am getting an error stating I need to be online. Is there a way to continue to work offline with the program?
Answer: **GameGuru MAX has a built-in license validation system that requires you to connect with Steam once at least every two weeks, using a valid Steam account with the product licensed to that account. Once this online step has been made, you can continue to use the product offline without the need to go online or connect to your Steam account.**

**Q**> After installing game guru MAX, the message appears, (failed to parse version list, please try again). I click on the button, check to update, and it doesn't update?
Answer: **GameGuru MAX moved to Steam many years ago as the only way to purchase the product. It sounds like you are using the older non-Steam version of MAX with 'auto-updater' that we no longer sell and support. We offered Steam Keys to all our customers of the non-Steam product and you can use that key to get the latest version of GameGuru MAX now available on Steam.**


## AppGameKit

**Q**> I have a question about the AGK Mobile app that runs on my Android and iOS devices. Can you help?
Answer: **AGK Mobile is developed by a third-party developer. We have no creation products that run on Android. We do sell AppGameKit which enables export to an APK that runs on Android, but you need to do the creation on a PC in Windows.**

**Q**> What AGK AppGameKit products do you sell?
Answer: **We sell two AGK products through Steam, AppGameKit Classic and AppGameKit Studio. Classic was created first and later we developed Studio and included more commands, features, and a new IDE. We also sell DLC created by ourselves and by third parties that are compatible with AGK Classic and AGK Studio. We do not sell any products through our own TGC website and instead sell through Steam.**

**Q**> I need help using AppGameKit Classic or Studio, can you help?
Answer: **The best place to get regular advice and help is the AGK Forums. You can find the Classic forum here "https://forum.thegamecreators.com/board/41" and the Studio forum here "https://forum.thegamecreators.com/board/59".**

**Q**> I just downloaded the AppGameKit free trial! Would it be possible to access the serial port on a PC (or USB) from an AppGameKit program?
Answer: **There is no way to access the Serial Port or USB Port from AGK Classic or AGK Studio programs out of the box.**

**Q**> Does AppGameKit have support for any database? Does AppGameKit have the ability to call code written in other languages?
Answer: **For specific advice on what AppGameKit Classic and Studio can do, you can review the documentation or better, use the AGK forum to ask your questions. You can find the Classic forum here "https://forum.thegamecreators.com/board/41" and the Studio forum here "https://forum.thegamecreators.com/board/59".**


## Legacy Products

**Q**> I am making a game using the original DarkBasic and I noticed it had this pop-up saying "Enhancements for 6 days" and its counting down to 0. I would like to still use 1.0, do you still provide support?
Answer: **We no longer officially support our older legacy products such as DarkBASIC, DarkBASIC Pro, The 3D Gamemaker, and FPS Creator, and are unable to provide help if you choose to use them on modern Windows platforms. You may find some old forums still running that have a community surrounding these products, and they are your best bet for getting advice on what you are attempting. Thanks for checking out our past products, we appreciate the attention they still garner!**

**Q**> I installed the FPSC desert storm pack directly in the folders, and when I go into the inventory and scroll in the pack folder it crashes and I lose my work almost every 5 minutes, please help me!
Answer: **We no longer support FPSC, we only support those products we presently sell on Steam. We do however keep our legacy forums open and you can seek advice and help from the FPSC forum here: "https://forum.thegamecreators.com/board/21".**
